INTRODUCTION                                    *biblereader*

In any setup you can open a new vim buffer with results from |diatheke|. This
plugin is a wrapper for |diatheke|. The results will be opened in a new
buffer.

USAGE AND COMMANDS                              *biblereader-usage*

Use |:call| and one of these commands:

                                                *biblereader-FindInBible*
[V]FindInBible()        This will open a small dialog and ask you for a sword
                        module and a search request. This search request will
                        be directly added to the |diatheke| command. The
                        resulting text will be pasted in a new horizontal
                        buffer. When using the |V|-Version of the function the
                        new buffer will be split vertically.

                                                *biblereader-PasteVerse*
PasteVerse()            This will open the same dialog. The resulting text
                        will be pasted at your current cursor position. You
                        can review the result before it is pasted.
